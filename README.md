### Network Status Monitor v1.0

Network Status Monitor monitors connection changes/updates (connecting or disconnecting from a network) and logs that data. The log data includes the connection type (whether was on ethernet or wifi), the status (whether it disconnected or connected), the time the change happened, and the duration time of that status before it changed. My ethernet connection kept disconnecting and reconnecting itself from my router and I wanted to see if there was a pattern (or if the cable or router was busted); I couldn't find any program online that did this so I made my own and it ended up being pretty useful so I'm making it open source.
